**WARNING:** The file given in this challenge is a **real malware**!  
Please be careful or use a **virtual machine**.  
*(You do NOT need to execute it to solve the challenge.)*  

I wanted to automate a task in Task Scheduler on my Windows machine, but then I found a task called **'Chromeniumscrypt'** that was set to execute the file `updates.ps1`.  
I’m not sure if it’s legit from a trusted source or not. Anyways, I **removed the extension** to avoid executing it by mistake.
